## Welcome

Amazon Cognito is an identity platform that helps developers set up customer identity and access management (CIAM) for web and mobile apps. It allows users to sign up, sign in, and access applications, web portals, or digital services. Cognito acts as a user directory, authentication server, and authorization service. It can authenticate and authorize users from a built-in user directory, an enterprise directory, or consumer identity providers like Google and Facebook.

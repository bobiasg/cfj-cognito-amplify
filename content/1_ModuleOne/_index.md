# Introduction

## What you'll be building
Implementing Authentication in a Next.js 14 Application with AWS Cognito and NextAuth Integration

When building a Next.js 14 application, implementing robust authentication is crucial for securing user data and managing access to various parts of your application. By integrating AWS Cognito with the NextAuth library, you can create a seamless sign-in/sign-up experience that leverages AWS's secure and scalable user authentication service.

In this workshop, we’ll walk through how to set up Cognito for a simple web app. We’ll perform these steps:

- Create a Cognito user pool
- Add sign-in pages
- Assign IAM roles to authenticated users
- Access AWS resources from the app
<!-- - Verify email addresses and phone numbers -->

This workshop should take you anywhere between 1 to 4 hours to complete.

## What you will learn

During this workshop you use multiple AWS services including:

- Amazon Cognito

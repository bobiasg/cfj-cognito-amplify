## Integration with Other AWS Services
Currently, there are many user management platforms, such as Clerk, Auth0, etc, that offer authentication features. Each of these services has unique advantages compared to AWS Cognito. However, when an application requires access to AWS resources, itâ€™s essential to implement proper authorization and use Developer credentials/SDK to interact with those resources. 

Cognito integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like API Gateway, Lambda, S3, and DynamoDB. This allows you to build comprehensive, robust, scalable, serverless applications where authentication and authorization are tightly coupled with your backend services.

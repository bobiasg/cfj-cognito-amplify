Your new Authorizer is ready, but before we attach this to the API letâ€™s explore the test functionality. Click Test authorizer. This will bring up a dialog, this is expecting what we would send to the API in an Authorization header. We will send a Bearer token that was generated earlier in Postman. Leave this dialog open.

## Attach Authorizer to the API
We now have all the parts to add authentication to the API. In this section we will restrict access to the _/pets_ end point.

To confirm this is all working as expected return to Postman and open a new tab, take the API URL ( you should still have this in a browser tab, if not navigate back to API Gateway, click Stages in the left menu and copy the URL from the highlighted section at the top next to Invoke URL ) and paste this in, click send to see the result

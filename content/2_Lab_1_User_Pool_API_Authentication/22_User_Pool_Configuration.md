# Resouce Server

We are now ready to further configure our user pool, we will begin by adding a resource server. As this lab will grant access to a Mock API at this stage we will create the resource and scope that will provide authenticated access to the get method of the API.

Select the App Integration tab and click on Create resource server

There are a number of options to enable, ensure yours look the same as the image.

First we add the Allowed sign-out URL to https://localhost

Under OAuth 2.0 Grant Types select

- Authorization code grant and
- Implicit grant


{{% notice note %}}
The implicit grant flow exposes OAuth tokens in the url. Although we are using it here for testing purposes only, we strongly reocmmend you only use the authroization code flow with PKCE for public clients.
